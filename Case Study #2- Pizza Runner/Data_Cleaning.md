# Pizza Runner üçï

The data in the `runner_orders` and `customer_orders` tables contain some `'null'` and `NaN` values therefore the data has to be clean so that we can query the data from those tables to solve Danny's problems. 
To clean the data, i used temporary tables to create a copy of the `runner_orders` and `customer_orders` tables and used `CASE WHEN` statements to clean the data into those temporary tables.

Cleaning `runner_orders`
-------------

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_orders_temp;
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS (
                      SELECT order_id,
                          runner_id,
                         -- converting `'null'` values into actual `NULL` values
                         CASE WHEN pickup_time IS NULL OR pickup_time LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL ELSE pickup_time END AS pickup_time,
                          CASE WHEN distance IS NULL OR distance LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL 
	                             WHEN distance LIKE '%km%' THEN trim('km' from distance) ELSE distance END AS distance,
                          CASE WHEN duration IS NULL OR duration LIKE '%null%' THEN NULL
	                             WHEN duration LIKE '%mins%' THEN TRIM('mins' FROM duration)
	                             WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes%' THEN TRIM('minutes' FROM duration)
	                             WHEN duration LIKE '%minute%' THEN TRIM( 'minute' FROM duration)
	                             ELSE duration END AS duration,
                          CASE WHEN cancellation IS NULL OR cancellation LIKE '%null%' THEN '' ELSE cancellation END AS cancellation
                      FROM runner_orders
                      );
```

I used `CREATE TEMP TABLE` syntax to create a temporary table called `runner_orders_temp`. The `order_id` and `runner_id` do not cleaning so I selected them into the temporary table just as they were in the original table.
The `pickup_time` column had two `'null'` values so I converted those values into actual `NULL` values.

The `distance` column also has some `'null'` values so I converted those values to actual `NULL` values. However, the other values had `km` attached to the numbers so I had to remove to enable me convert the column to an `int` later.
I did this by identifying the values with `km` and using the `TRIM()` function to trim `km` from the nnumbers.

The duration column also has `'null'` values so I used `CASE WHEN` statement to convert them to actual `NULL` values. The other values have `'mins'`, `'minutes'` and `'minute'`
attached to their numeric values so I had to remove them to enable me convert the column to an `int` later. I used the `WHEN` statement to identify the values with  `'mins'`, `'minutes'` and `'minute'` then I used the `TRIM()` function to remove those words from the 
numbers.

The `cancellation` column has `'null'` and `Nan` values. PostgreSQL recognizes `NaN` values as `NULL` values. Converting the `'null'` values to `NULL` values will make the table clumsy
so instead I converted them to `''`. Unlike most RDMS, PostgreSQL does not recognize `''` as NULL.

The resulting table is below.
