Pizza Runner is an _uberized_ pizza delivery business. Runners pick up orders from the Pizza Runner headquarters and deliver to customers. The owner has collected data on the orders, runners and customers and would like the data analyzed so he can optimize his business.

However, the data is messy and will need some cleaning before analysis. The queries used to clean the data are contained in the [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Outis09/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232-%20Pizza%20Runner/Data_Cleaning.md) file. 

The owner's business questions have been grouped into four:
* **[Pizza Metrics](https://github.com/Outis09/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232-%20Pizza%20Runner/Solutions/Pizza%20Metrics.md)** - questions on number of unique orders, orders for each pizza type and breakdown of orders by hour of day.
* **[Runner and Customer Experience](https://github.com/Outis09/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232-%20Pizza%20Runner/Solutions/Runner%20and%20Customer%20Experience.md)** - questions on runners, cancelled orders and delivery times.
* **[Ingredient Optimisation](https://github.com/Outis09/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232-%20Pizza%20Runner/Solutions/Ingredients%20Optimization.md)** - questions on ingredients used in pizza preparations.
* **[Pricing and Ratings](https://github.com/Outis09/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/blob/main/Case%20Study%20%232-%20Pizza%20Runner/Solutions/Pricing%20and%20Ratings.md)** - questions on revenue, and delivery costs.
