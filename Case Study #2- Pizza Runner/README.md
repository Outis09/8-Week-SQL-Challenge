This is the second challenge of the 8 week SQL challenge created by Danny Ma. The full case study can be accessed at [Pizza Runner](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/).
My solution to the previous challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/Outis09/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/tree/main/Case%20Study%20%231-%20Danny's%20Diner). 

The **data** in this case study needed some cleaning so I cleaned it. My data cleaning method can be accessed at [Data Cleaning](Data_Cleaning.md).

The **dataset** can be found in the [schema](schema.md) file.

The **case** study can be found in the [case study](case_study.md) file.

This case study tests :
-----------
  
  * Data Cleaning with SQL
  * Temporary Tables
  * Common Table Expressions
  * Dealing with NULL values
  * Table Joins 
  * Casting
