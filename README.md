The 8 week SQL challenge was created by Danny Ma. 
It contains 8 case studies to be solved using SQL.
The case studies can be accessed at [8 week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/)

The topics covered in the case studies include;
* Health analytics
* Marketing analytics
* People analytics
* Financial markets
* Fast moving consumer goods
* Digital marketing

I used PostgreSQL to solve the case studies
