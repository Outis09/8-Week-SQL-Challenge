The 8 week SQL challenge was created by Danny Ma. 
It contains 8 case studies to be solved using SQL.
The case studies can be accessed at [8 week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/)
I started the challenge to practice and imporve my SQL skills because SQL is a very important component of Data Science and Data Analysis.
